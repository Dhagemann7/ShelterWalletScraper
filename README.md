# ShelterWalletScraper
A python script to scrape a list of websites by url and search for Etherium Wallets.
This script requires the packages json, requests, requests_oauthlib, and oauthlib.
For this to work, you must save a .txt file under C:/users/public/keys.txt, and have the first line be your client id, and the second line be your secret id.
